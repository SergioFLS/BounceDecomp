# BounceDecomp

This is an attempt to create lazy Bounce decompilations that do, at least... compile. Made using Recaf v2.21.13 with the FernFlower decompiler.

Newer versions are commited, which (hopefully) gives you a nice diff.

## (No) License
This is a decompilation of propietary software, which that itself is copyright infringement.

If you wanna use this decompilation for whatever purpose, I'm not stopping you, though whatever the current copyright holder of Bounce is (Nokia, maybe?) might, however.

Use it at your own risk and happy pirating!

(seriously... who came up with copyright law?)
